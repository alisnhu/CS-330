How do I approach designing software?

a. What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

Throughout the project, I gained more experience in 3D modeling and visualization. In particular, my ability to combine geometric forms to create more complex structures improved. Additionally, I made progress in user interface design and understanding visual hierarchy.

b. What design process did you follow for your project work?

In my project, I first created a basic draft, then designed the main components of the laptop (body, screen, keyboard). The design process involved a detailed consideration of how each component would look and interact, keeping user experience in mind. Finally, I revised my design based on feedback.

c. How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The experiences gained in improving visual design can be applied to future projects. I have previously worked with web design, so I am good at 2D design using code, but visualizing 3D design through code and simply looking at the code to imagine the visuals is a new and valuable experience.

How do I approach developing programs?

a. What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

Throughout the project, I developed a more modular code structure, allowing each component to be developed separately. This increased code reusability and made the debugging process easier. Additionally, I attempted to simulate some features not found in the provided libraries.

b. How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration played a critical role in my project's development process. By testing the components I created at each stage, I was able to quickly identify and fix issues. This resulted in a better product at every stage of my project.

c. How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

As the project progressed, I transitioned from a simple modeling and visualization approach to more complex graphic calculations. Initially, I wrote the code more experimentally, but as I advanced, I adopted a planned and structured approach. This change helped me complete the project more efficiently.

How can it help me achieve my Computer Science goals?

a. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Computational graphics and visualization techniques have significantly enhanced my visualization skills. I believe I can produce more successful outcomes in future projects, especially those involving visualization.

b. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

In my professional life, skills in computational graphics and visualization will help make projects more engaging and understandable. Additionally, the ability to develop effective visual tools to improve user experience will increase my value in the workforce. Being knowledgeable in these areas will make me a more competitive candidate.
